Employee Tracker Your Challenge this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.  Because this application won't be deployed, you'll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You'll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.  Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.  User Story AS A business owner I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company SO THAT I can organize and plan my business Acceptance Criteria GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input WHEN I start the application THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role WHEN I choose to view all departments THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids WHEN I choose to view all roles THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role WHEN I choose to view all employees THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to WHEN I choose to add a department THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database WHEN I choose to add a role THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database WHEN I choose to add an employee THEN I am prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database WHEN I choose to update an employee role THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

To build this Employee Tracker application, you'll need to create a command-line application using Node.js, Inquirer for handling user prompts, and PostgreSQL for managing the database. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to structure your project, meet the requirements, and create a walkthrough video for your submission.

Project Structure
Create a project folder for your app, e.g., employee-tracker.
Initialize a Node.js project by running:
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Install necessary packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install inquirer pg
Set up your project files:
app.js: The main file where your command-line app will run.
db/connection.js: To handle PostgreSQL database connections.
db/schema.sql: SQL file for creating the required tables in PostgreSQL.
db/seeds.sql: SQL file for adding initial data (departments, roles, employees).
README.md: Document your project here.
Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database:

Open your PostgreSQL terminal or use a database client.
Create a new database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE employee_tracker;
Design your database schema:

Define tables for departments, roles, and employees.
Here’s a possible schema:

sql
Copy code
-- Departments Table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Roles Table
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id)
);

-- Employees Table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id),
    manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id)
);
Seed initial data (optional for testing):

Use db/seeds.sql to populate some departments, roles, and employees for testing.
Database connection file (db/connection.js):

Create a connection to your PostgreSQL database.
javascript
Copy code
const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password',
    database: 'employee_tracker'
});

client.connect();

module.exports = client;
Application Logic
In app.js, you’ll handle all the user interactions using Inquirer.

Import dependencies:

javascript
Copy code
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const client = require('./db/connection');
Create Inquirer prompts for each option:

Main Menu:

javascript
Copy code
function mainMenu() {
    inquirer.prompt({
        type: 'list',
        name: 'choice',
        message: 'What would you like to do?',
        choices: [
            'View All Departments',
            'View All Roles',
            'View All Employees',
            'Add Department',
            'Add Role',
            'Add Employee',
            'Update Employee Role',
            'Exit'
        ]
    }).then(answer => {
        switch (answer.choice) {
            case 'View All Departments':
                viewDepartments();
                break;
            case 'View All Roles':
                viewRoles();
                break;
            case 'View All Employees':
                viewEmployees();
                break;
            case 'Add Department':
                addDepartment();
                break;
            case 'Add Role':
                addRole();
                break;
            case 'Add Employee':
                addEmployee();
                break;
            case 'Update Employee Role':
                updateEmployeeRole();
                break;
            case 'Exit':
                client.end();
                console.log('Goodbye!');
                break;
        }
    });
}
Define each function to handle the database operations:

View Departments:

javascript
Copy code
function viewDepartments() {
    client.query('SELECT * FROM departments', (err, res) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.table(res.rows);
        mainMenu();
    });
}
View Roles:

javascript
Copy code
function viewRoles() {
    client.query(
        `SELECT roles.id, roles.title, departments.name AS department, roles.salary 
         FROM roles 
         JOIN departments ON roles.department_id = departments.id`,
        (err, res) => {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.table(res.rows);
            mainMenu();
        }
    );
}
View Employees:

javascript
Copy code
function viewEmployees() {
    client.query(
        `SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, employees.last_name, roles.title, departments.name AS department, roles.salary,
                 manager.first_name AS manager 
         FROM employees 
         LEFT JOIN roles ON employees.role_id = roles.id 
         LEFT JOIN departments ON roles.department_id = departments.id 
         LEFT JOIN employees manager ON employees.manager_id = manager.id`,
        (err, res) => {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.table(res.rows);
            mainMenu();
        }
    );
}
Add Department, Role, Employee, and Update Employee Role functions:

Each of these functions will prompt the user for input using Inquirer and then execute a SQL INSERT or UPDATE command to make changes to the database.
Running the Application
Start the application with:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Test each function to ensure it works as expected, meeting each requirement in the Acceptance Criteria.

Creating the Walkthrough Video
Plan the video: Outline the actions you’ll demonstrate to show each feature.
Record the video:
Use screen recording software like OBS, QuickTime, or another preferred tool.
Start with an introduction of the app.
Walk through each menu option, demonstrating viewing, adding, and updating database entries.
Save the video and upload it to a platform like YouTube or a cloud service.
Add the video link to your README.
README.md
Your README should include:

Project Title and Description
Installation and Usage Instructions
How to Start the Application

To help you get started with the Employee Tracker assessment, I'll guide you through the implementation and walk you through each necessary step. I'll provide code samples and explanations that should lead you toward a working command-line application.

Step-by-Step Solution for the Employee Tracker
1. Set Up Your Project
Initialize a new Node.js project in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
mkdir employee-tracker
cd employee-tracker
npm init -y
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install inquirer pg
2. Configure Your PostgreSQL Database
Create the Database:

Open PostgreSQL and create a database for the project:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE employee_tracker;
Create the Schema for Tables

You’ll need three tables: departments, roles, and employees.

sql
Copy code
-- departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id)
);

-- employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id),
    manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id)
);
Populate the Database with Initial Data (Optional):

You can create a file called db/seeds.sql with sample data for testing:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO departments (name) VALUES ('Sales'), ('Engineering'), ('Finance');

INSERT INTO roles (title, salary, department_id) VALUES 
    ('Sales Manager', 60000, 1),
    ('Software Engineer', 80000, 2),
    ('Accountant', 50000, 3);

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, role_id, manager_id) VALUES 
    ('Alice', 'Johnson', 1, NULL),
    ('Bob', 'Smith', 2, 1),
    ('Charlie', 'Brown', 3, NULL);
3. Set Up the Database Connection
Create a file db/connection.js to handle the PostgreSQL connection.

javascript
Copy code
const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password',
    database: 'employee_tracker'
});

client.connect();

module.exports = client;
4. Main Application Logic
In the app.js file, create the command-line interface logic using Inquirer.

Import Dependencies:

javascript
Copy code
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const client = require('./db/connection');
Create the Main Menu:

The main menu lets users choose between viewing, adding, and updating database entries.
javascript
Copy code
function mainMenu() {
    inquirer.prompt({
        type: 'list',
        name: 'action',
        message: 'What would you like to do?',
        choices: [
            'View All Departments',
            'View All Roles',
            'View All Employees',
            'Add Department',
            'Add Role',
            'Add Employee',
            'Update Employee Role',
            'Exit'
        ]
    }).then(answer => {
        switch (answer.action) {
            case 'View All Departments': return viewDepartments();
            case 'View All Roles': return viewRoles();
            case 'View All Employees': return viewEmployees();
            case 'Add Department': return addDepartment();
            case 'Add Role': return addRole();
            case 'Add Employee': return addEmployee();
            case 'Update Employee Role': return updateEmployeeRole();
            default: client.end(); console.log('Goodbye!');
        }
    });
}
Define Functions to Handle Each Option:

View Departments:

javascript
Copy code
function viewDepartments() {
    client.query('SELECT * FROM departments', (err, res) => {
        if (err) throw err;

        JOIN departments ON roles.department_id = departments.id;
    `;
    client.query(query, (err, res) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.table(res.rows);
        mainMenu();
    });
}

    const query = `
        SELECT employees.id, employees.first_name, employees.last_name, roles.title, departments.name AS department, roles.salary,
               manager.first_name AS manager 
        FROM employees 
        LEFT JOIN roles ON employees.role_id = roles.id 
        LEFT JOIN departments ON roles.department_id = departments.id 
        LEFT JOIN employees AS manager ON employees.manager_id = manager.id;
    `;
    client.query(query, (err, res) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.table(res.rows);
        mainMenu();
    });
}

    ]).then(answers => {
        client.query(
            'INSERT INTO roles (title, salary, department_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)',
            [answers.title, answers.salary, answers.department_id],
            (err) => {
                if (err) throw err;
                console.log('Role added!');
                mainMenu();
            }
        );
    });
}

The error indicates that PostgreSQL cannot find the schema.sql file at the specified path. To resolve this issue:

Verify the File Path
Ensure you’re in the correct directory when running psql. Check your current directory:

bash
Copy code
pwd
Confirm the exact location of schema.sql. Use:

bash
Copy code
ls -l scr/db/schema.sql
If the file is missing or the directory structure is incorrect, ensure the file exists and is saved in the intended location.

Adjust the Path in psql
If the file is located elsewhere, provide the absolute path:

bash
Copy code
\i /absolute/path/to/schema.sql
For example:

bash
Copy code
\i /Users/atudior/Projects/Employee-tracker/scr/db/schema.sql
If you want to avoid using the absolute path, navigate to the directory where schema.sql is located before starting psql:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/schema.sql
psql -U postgres
\i schema.sql
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Spelling errors: Check that the folder name scr is correct. Often, it’s intended to be src.
Permissions: Ensure you have permission to read the file. Change permissions if necessary:
bash
Copy code
chmod 644 /path/to/schema.sql
File existence: Verify the file exists by using:
bash
Copy code
ls /path/to/schema.sql
Retry the Command
Once you’ve verified the correct path and file existence, rerun the command:

bash
Copy code
\i /correct/path/to/schema.sql

The error suggests there is a syntax issue in the src/db/schema.sql file. PostgreSQL is encountering a problem with a ) in the SQL script. Let's troubleshoot and fix it:

Steps to Identify and Fix the Issue
Examine the schema.sql File: Look closely at the file, especially around line 6 and line 15, where PostgreSQL indicates there are syntax errors.

Verify Table Definitions: Check each CREATE TABLE statement to ensure correct syntax. A typical table creation in PostgreSQL looks like this:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
Common Issues to Check:

Missing or extra commas between column definitions.
Using reserved keywords as column or table names.
Improper placement of );.
PostgreSQL Reserved Words: Avoid using PostgreSQL reserved words (e.g., name, role, user) as column or table names unless explicitly quoted.

Example of Corrected Schema
Here’s a sample corrected schema file based on typical errors:

sql
Copy code
-- Drop and recreate the database
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS employee_db;
CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
\c employee_db;

-- Create departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Create roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    department_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(id)
);

-- Create employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id),
    manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
Debugging Tips
Line Numbers in Errors: PostgreSQL reports errors based on lines, so:

Line 6: Likely an issue in the CREATE TABLE departments or immediately after.
Line 15: Likely an issue in CREATE TABLE roles or CREATE TABLE employees.
Test Incrementally: Instead of running the whole script, test each CREATE TABLE statement one at a time to pinpoint the issue:

sql
Copy code
\i src/db/schema.sql
Run Syntax Check: If you're using a code editor with SQL linting, use it to identify syntax issues before executing the script.

Re-run the Script
Once you’ve corrected the file, execute it again:

bash
Copy code
\i src/db/schema.sql
Let me know if the issue persists, and we can debug further!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that you're running the \i command directly in your terminal (zsh), but this command is specific to the PostgreSQL interactive terminal (psql). You need to first connect to psql before using the \i command.

Correct Steps to Run seed.sql
Connect to PostgreSQL: Open the PostgreSQL interactive terminal:

bash
Copy code
psql -U postgres
If prompted, enter your PostgreSQL password.

Connect to Your Database: Switch to the employee_db database:

sql
Copy code
\c employee_db
Run the seed.sql File: Use the \i command to execute the seed script:

sql
Copy code
\i src/db/seed.sql
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Running \i outside psql: Always ensure you're inside the psql terminal when using PostgreSQL-specific commands like \i.
File Path Issues: Double-check the file path to seed.sql. If the file is not in src/db, adjust the path accordingly.
Example Workflow
bash
Copy code
# Open PostgreSQL terminal
psql -U postgres

# Switch to your database
\c employee_db

# Run the seed script
\i src/db/seed.sql
If you encounter additional issues, let me know!
